Time is the our most definitive limitation.

If one doesn't take time seriously and study its workings how can one
hope to accomplish anything?  Very likely, your aims are so
unrealistic that there is not enough time to do what you want to do.

Stop waiting!

There is not so much time that you can afford to waste it.  Not even
one moment!

Time is impersonal.
